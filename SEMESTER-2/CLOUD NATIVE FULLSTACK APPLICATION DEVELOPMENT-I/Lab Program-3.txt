QUES: Write a Java program to demonstrate the concepts.
i)Abstraction, Run Time Polymorphism


//Program-3


Question: write a java program to create an abstract class printer and implement all
the methods using the concrete classes.

Step 1: Create a abstract class called the printer with the methods like configuration and display
Step 2: Create two concrete classes “Dot-matrix” and “LaserJet”. Implement the abstract class
printer and its methods with respect to the abstract class.
Step 3: A Main class with a menu driven program for implementing the abstraction



Expected Output:
The program should display the details of the Dot-matrix and LaserJet class details with
an implementation of the abstract class.




2) Runtime polymorphism:
Example program that showcases runtime polymorphism using a class hierarchy of
vehicles



Question: write a java program:
a. Create a vehicle interface with a concrete class as car and motorcycle to
implement the vehicle interface methods

b. Demonstrate runtime polymorphism with an abstract class

Step wise Execution Procedure:
Step 1: Creating abstract class vehicle.
Step 2: Create method Drive ( )
Step 3: Create two concrete classes, Car and Motorcycle, which inherit from the
Vehicle class. Each subclass provides its own implementation of the drive () method
Step 4: Create Main class, create objects of type Vehicle but instantiate them as Car
and Motorcycle
Step 5: Demonstrate the concept of polymorphism

Expected Output:
The program should display the common interface called from the respective classes.
