Ques: Demonstrate with Spring Boot: Setup a Kubernetes development Env on your Sandbox (use Docker Desktop or Minicube)


Program 10:

Steps:

1. Download jar file from folder prog-8:

2. Open new terminal and change Directory to the folder that contain jar file.

3. Install Minikube

4. Start Minikube by running the " minikube start " command.

5. Minikube comes with its Docker daemon. You need to configure your Docker CLI to use Minikube's Docker daemon. You can do this by running -- " eval $(minikube docker-env) "

6. create a Dockerfile using command “nano Dockerfile”.

7. paste these line of code in Dockerfile and save it.

FROM eclipse-temurin:17-jdk-alpine
MAINTAINER myNAME
COPY demorest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar /home/demorest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
CMD ["java","-jar","/home/demorest-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar"]


8. Build the image using " docker build -t lab10:latest . "

9. Once the image is built, create a Kubernetes manifests and refer image in your Kubernetes manifest using command -- "nano kuber.yaml "


kuber.yaml

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deploy
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: myapp
        image: lab10:latest
        imagePullPolicy: Never
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: myapp-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: myapp
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 8080



10. Apply the Kubernetes manifest containing the Deployment and service configuration to Minikube using the command -- " kubectl apply -f kuber.yaml "

11. Check the status of the pods, it must show status as Running -- " kubectl get pods "

12. Deployment and Service have been successfully configured in your Kubernetes cluster. You can verify this by checking the status of the Deployment and Service using command -- 

kubectl get deployment myapp-deploy
kubectl get service myapp-service

13. Note down the NodePort that you get by running command -- " kubectl get service myapp-service "

14. Determine the IP address of any of your Kubernetes nodes using command -- " minikube ip "

15. Then, access your application in a web browser using the following URL format (http://<minikube-ip>:<node-port>/person)    EXAMPLE: (http://192.168.1.100:30190/person)

16.After starting the service open postman and use get, post, delete for demonstration. 

17. GET: http://<ip>:<port>/person

18. POST: http://<ip>:<port>/person
{
"name": "",
"address": ""
}

19. DELETE: http://<ip>:<port>/person?name=<>


20. stop and restart the minikube using command--

minikube stop
minikube start
